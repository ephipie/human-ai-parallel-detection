But reporters' eyebrows raised when he said that White House Chief of Staff Dennis McDonough knew about abuses taking place in the IRS and decided not to tell the president. In a briefing that started 45 minutes late after a one-hour announced delay, Carney said that 'no one in this building intervened in an ongoing, independent investigation' by the IRS Office of Inspector General, which was examining 'line IRS employees' who were targeting conservative groups for special scrutiny. 'We did not have a copy of the draft report, we did not know the details, the scope, or the motivation surrounding the misconduct,' Carney said. 'And we did not know who was responsible.' But he confirmed that on April 24 Kathy Ruemmler, the White House Counsel, was notified about the investigation. He also said the White House chief of staff learned about it, as 'some other members of the senior staff - I don't have a list.' They decided, Carney recalled, to keep Obama in the dark. 'Some matters are inappropriate to convey to him,' Carney said. 'It . is entirely appropriate that the president not be notified' of ongoing . investigations,' he told reporters. 'The suggestion of alerting him is . that he should do something,' perhaps prematurely. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . White House Counsel Kathy Ruemmler (L) is the White House Counsel who first learned about the IRS investigation into agents who targeted tea party groups. James Rosen (R) is a Fox News reporter whose personal emails, phone records, and entry logs into federal buildings were snooped on by the DOJ . On April 16, he added, the White House Counsel's Office had received a 'top line,' non-specific notification that an investigative report would be forthcoming. 'The Hill also got briefings,' Carney said, referring to members of Congress on Capitol Hill. And like the White House, he said, Congress took no action. 'The cardinal rule,' he insisted, is that 'you do not intervene in an independent investigation.' Polls show an increasing number of Americans believe the IRS's targeting of tea party groups, the State Department's involvement in sanitizing a CIA assessment of the 2012 Benghazi terror attack and the Justice Department's investigation of reporters at the Associated Press are serious problems that have caused them to lose faith in the president and his team. Ruemmler embraced President Obama upon the news that the Supreme Court had upheld the Obamacare law, as then-White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew (L) looked on . On Monday, Fox News Chief Washington Correspondent James Rosen became the second First Amendment casualty in the Obama administration's probes into journalists' sources and communications.\",\n          \"The last of the great cities died when my father was a child.

Any gathering of the people at Barton's was a most rare occurrence; yet, on that day and at that hour, whoever stood upon the porch of the corner house, in the village, could see horsemen approaching by all the four roads which there met. Some five or six had already dismounted at the Unicorn Tavern, and were refreshing themselves with stout glasses of \\\"Old Rye,\\\" while their horses, tethered side by side to the pegs in the long hitching-bar, pawed and stamped impatiently. An eye familiar with the ways of the neighborhood might have surmised the nature of the occasion which called so many together, from the appearance and equipment of these horses. They were not heavy animals, with the marks of plough-collars on their broad shoulders, or the hair worn off their rumps by huge breech-straps; but light and clean-limbed, one or two of them showing signs of good blood, and all more carefully groomed than usual. Evidently, there was no \\\"vendue\\\" at the Barton farmhouse; neither a funeral, nor a wedding, since male guests seemed to have been exclusively bidden. To be sure, Miss Betsy Lavender had been observed to issue from Dr. Deane's door, on the opposite side of the way, and turn into the path beyond the blacksmith's, which led down through the wood and over the creek to Barton's; but then, Miss Lavender was known to be handy at all times, and capable of doing all things, from laying out a corpse to spicing a wedding-cake. Often self-invited, but always welcome, very few social or domestic events could occur in four townships (East Marlborough, Kennett, Pennsbury, and New-Garden) without her presence; while her knowledge of farms, families, and genealogies extended up to Fallowfield on one side, and over to Birmingham on the other. It was, therefore, a matter of course, whatever the present occasion might be, that Miss Lavender put on her broad gray beaver hat, and brown stuff cloak, and took the way to Barton's. The distance could easily be walked in five minutes, and the day was remarkably pleasant for the season. A fortnight of warm, clear weather had extracted the last fang of frost, and there was already green grass in the damp hollows. Bluebirds picked the last year's berries from the cedar-trees; buds were bursting on the swamp-willows; the alders were hung with tassels, and a powdery crimson bloom began to dust the bare twigs of the maple-trees. All these signs of an early spring Miss Lavender noted as she picked her way down the wooded bank. Once, indeed, she stopped, wet her forefinger with her tongue, and held it pointed in the air.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk_2\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 600,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The Washington Post reported Monday that the Justice Department investigated Rosen's contacts with a State Department source, tracking his phone calls, rummaging through his personal emails and tracing his entries into and exits from government buildings. Carney refused Monday to comment on 'an ongoing investigation,' falling back on previous statements that straddled the line between press freedoms and national security. Obama, he said, is 'a strong believer in the first amendment' but also 'insistent that we protect our secrets' as a nation. 'We take very seriously the leaks of classified information,' he added,' referring to both the AP and Fox News cases. But he wouldn't answer a question from Fox News about whether the While House believes Rosen is a criminal because he did his job and developed a source inside the State Department. And he dodged a question about how he personally views the scandal. Carney was the Washington Bureau Chief for Time Magazine before joining the Obama administration. 'I'm here as a spokesman for the president,' he insisted, before saying 'we need to find a balance' between protecting journalists' constitutional rights and preventing leaks of classified information to the media. Rosen reported in June 2009 that North Korea would respond to new UN sanctions by conducting a new round of nuclear tests. That report was based on a confidential source whom the DOJ has now identified. Carney continued to face brutally frank questions from reporters who may feel their ability to do their jobs without government interference has now been threatened by the Obama administration . Reaction from the press corps in general has been fast and furious, even bringing condemnation from left-leaning reporters who typically support the president's agenda. Liberal radio host Bill Press, Current TV host David Shuster and former MSNBC luminary Keith Olbermann have called for the resignation of Attorney General Eric Holder. And Glenn Greenwald, the progressive columnist at The Guardian in London, opined Monday on Twitter that '[a]ccusing James Rosen of committing crimes - for basic reporting - may be the most dangerous thing the Obama DOJ has done yet.' 'Who will be the first progressive pundit to defend the criminalization of James Rosen's report by the Obama DOJ or argue it's no big deal?' he asked his social media audience. Despite President Obama's claims on May 16 that he was unaware of the storm swirling around the IRS until media reports on May 10 put it on America's front-burner, news emerged Monday that Ruemmler was briefed on the agency's program targeting tea party groups and other political adversaries of the president in April. Full press briefing rooms have been the norm at the White House since a trio of scandals broke earlier in May. Jay Carney is the Obama administration's designated flak-catcher, parrying journalists' questions as nerves in the press corps fray .\",\n          \"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the day after that.

Here, the wood ceased, and the creek, sweeping around to the eastward, embraced a quarter of a mile of rich bottomland, before entering the rocky dell below. It was a pleasant seat, and the age of the house denoted that one of the earliest settlers had been quick to perceive its advantages. A hundred years had already elapsed since the masons had run up those walls of rusty hornblende rock, and it was even said that the leaden window-sashes, with their diamond-shaped panes of greenish glass, had been brought over from England, in the days of William Penn. In fact, the ancient aspect of the place -- the tall, massive chimney at the gable, the heavy, projecting eaves, and the holly-bush in a warm nook beside the front porch, had, nineteen years before, so forcibly reminded one of Howe's soldiers of his father's homestead in mid-England, that he was numbered among the missing after the Brandywine battle, and presently turned up as a hired hand on the Barton farm, where he still lived, year in and year out. An open, grassy space, a hundred yards in breadth, intervened between the house and the barn, which was built against the slope of the knoll, so that the bridge to the threshing-floor was nearly level, and the stables below were sheltered from the north winds, and open to the winter sun. On the other side of the lane leading from the high-road stood a wagon-house and corn-crib -- the latter empty, yet evidently, in spite of its emptiness, the principal source of attraction to the visitors. A score of men and boys peeped between the upright laths, and a dozen dogs howled and sprang around the smooth corner-posts upon which the structure rested. At the door stood old Giles, the military straggler already mentioned -- now a grizzly, weather-beaten man of fifty -- with a jolly grin on his face, and a short leather whip in his hand. \\\"Want to see him, Miss Betsy?\\\" he asked, touching his mink-skin cap, as Miss Lavender crawled through the nearest panel of the lofty picket fence. \\\"See him?\\\" she repeated. \\\"Don't care if I do, afore goin' into th' house.\\\" \\\"Come up, then; out o' the way, Cato!

In the bustling press room of the White House, where tensions simmered as eagerly as the journalists' impatience, Rosen was emblematic of a broader concern. Carney, whose smiles had worn as thin as the patience of the gathered reporters, continued to stand staunchly by the administration's decisions, though the heat of dissent began to fray the polished fabric of official statements. 'We respect the First Amendment,' Carney reiterated, though the room's silence pressed upon him like a barometer of unease. 'We operate within a legal framework that balances national security with press freedom.' His words ricocheted, failing to pass unscathed through the gauntlet of skepticism that fevered the air. Across the Beltway, the mood was one of vigilant scrutiny as Capitol Hill kept its pulse on the scandals encroaching like wildfires on the edges of credibility. Lawmakers, too, had their own portended orations ready, each shaped to line their agendas with moral superiority, ethics cloaked in political stratagems. The scandals, synapses of the same troubled nerve, entwined themselves around dinner table discussions throughout America. The IRS seemed a specter rattling chains of mistrust, conjuring memories of batches of tax documents scrutinized not for numerical error but ideological adherence. The Benghazi episode, wrapped in diplomatic language, had already made its mark-a scar of ambiguity and blame. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice's indulgence in the near-intimate pursuit of reporters painted a disconcerting picture of intrusion seemingly at odds with democratic values. In the press room, questions volleyed with the force of accusatory missiles. Would the administration, by providence or design, emerge unscathed from the triad of besieging narratives? Carney's repeated assertions that the president's exclusion from certain knowledge was both deliberate and judicious was met with pursed lips and skeptical eyes. Such admissions only stirred further inquiry. Which matters, they pressed, deserved to pierce the veil of presidential ignorance, and at what cost to transparency? Kathy Ruemmler, seen occasionally whispering in Carney's ear, epitomized the tenuous bridge between constitutional confidence and the looming apparition of governance gone awry. Photographs of whispered confidences became symbols of clandestine conventions, fueling media narratives with images that spoke louder than definitive reporting ever could. Out in the corridors of power, allies and adversaries alike were caught in the centripetal force of scandal. The policy wonks and seasoned political players, insulated within their own echo chambers, postured and pronounced, observers in the unfolding political theater. Crystal balls had clouded, and fortune-tellers with poll data and public opinion cloaked themselves in caution, prophesizing with uncertainty. As dusk settled on a restless Washington, doubt and discourse rumbled like early summer storms. The country watched, listened, debated each reverberating report. From the cacophony in the press room to the quiet pensiveness of a nation at odds with its own ideals, the scandals brewed on, their resolutions as yet unwritten, an uncertain future casting its shadow ahead.\\\"\",\n          \"The echoes of old legends and current turmoil intertwined, casting shadows upon the rugged landscape. The lore of Macbeth, once a distant story of ambition and doom, seemed eerily relevant in these desperate times. The decimation of great cities had left not only physical ruins, but shadows on the hearts of people. So much was forgotten, but the tales of yore remained; words whispered around flickering fires, resounded in silence. Bill and I wandered, guided not by compass but sheer instinct and the will to survive. Each day was a battle of wits and endurance. We had learned not to trust easily, not to dwell long within walls that confined rather than protected. Open skies were our companions, and a star-studded blanket our cover. \\\"Remember, Bill,\\\" I'd say, \\\"never stand still, lest the past catch up with you.\\\" The morning sun burned away the fog of the night, leaving the earth steaming below our weary feet. We trudged along a path forsaken by all but the winds. In our silence, the world's history unfolded; a narrative of destruction and rebirth. Conversations with Bill mostly echoed in monologues punctuated by his occasional grunts of agreement. \\\"St. Rose better be where they say it is,\\\" I muttered, thoughts drifting to the promises of thriving lands unseen, where the earth yielded more than just rocky memories. Occasionally, we encountered other wanderers, their faces etched with stories of survival and endurance. We hailed one another cautiously, like wolves testing the night's air, gauging friend from foe. In such encounters, I always kept my hand close to where reassurance rested-a glinting piece of steel, a reminder of the rough world that circled us. One evening, we sat by a brook, its gentle babble a rare symphony. \\\"Bill, you think there's hope?\\\" I asked, more to fill the air than to expect an answer. Hope was a currency we traded sparingly, lest it lose value amidst the starkness of what surrounded us. Yard by yard, foot by foot, we dug deeper into the tangible dreams of a better tomorrow. A world where oceans healed, forests thrived, and children played unburdened by the sins of their fathers. In the distant wilds, tales told of communities not unlike those before the fall-places where harvests were bountiful, and children's laughter filled the air. Yet St. Rose seemed so far, like the last star one glimpses before dawn. \\\"Won't do us any good dreaming here,\\\" I murmured, as twilight draped the sky in purple and gold. With reluctant resolve, we packed our scant belongings, every item critical, each memory tied to survival. Bill stared into the flames, into the heart of inevitable change. Together, we embraced the uncertainty that lay beyond the horizon. The terrain may change, but the heartbeat of our journey remained. As we set off once more, a breeze whispered through the forest, a silent benediction to wanderers treading paths untold. Ahead loomed the unknown; behind, the restless past. Yet, amid it all, faint glimmers of hope persisted, like embers ready to ignite anew. The chapter wouldn't close here-it simply awaited the dawn of a new beginning.\",\n          \"The breeze was gentle and carried just a hint of warmth from the south, confirming her suspicion that the day promised fair weather. She resumed her walk with renewed energy, the silver buckles on her shoes glinting briefly in the sunlight as she stepped over the roots and stones with practiced agility. As she neared the Barton farm-house, the hum of conversation grew louder, underscored by the occasional guffaw and clink of a tankard. At the gate, she paused momentarily to take in the scene. The old Barton farm-house, with its sturdy stone walls and wide, welcoming front porch, looked more animated than it had in many a year. The crowd was an eclectic mix of men, some in fine coats of the latest cut, others in the plain garb of Quakers, their broad-brimmed hats pulled low over faces that bore the mark of sun and stern weather. Here and there, a wave of recognition and greeting passed among them, punctuated by the warmth of camaraderie seldom seen outside of the market square or a harvest gathering. At the heart of the congregation stood a makeshift dais, upon which Abner Blossom, the newly elected magistrate, held forth with a booming voice that commanded attention. Beside him, Sir William Gresham, a visiting gentleman of some repute, nodded sagely, his demeanor exuding a mixture of respect and faint amusement. A table nearby was laden with papers, a quill standing at the ready in an inkpot, suggesting the gathering had both social and formal intentions. Miss Lavender, unnoticed at first, made her way around the fringes of the crowd with keen interest. Her ear caught snatches of phrases-agreements and disputes alike. It wasn't long before someone spotted her; the ripple of her presence threading through those gathered was marked by a few respectful nods and the slight shifting of bodies to make room for her closer to the proceedings. \\\"Ah, Miss Lavender!\\\" called Abner, his voice resounding with genuine warmth, \\\"Come, join us. Your wisdom is as valued as ever.\\\" She acknowledged his invitation with a gracious nod and moved forward, subtly taking in the expressions of those assembled-the furrowed brows of the farmers, the skeptical yet curious gaze of the landowners, and the intent focus of the younger men, absorbing the air of importance laid before them. Meanwhile, Samuel Porter, the ever-practical blacksmith known for his forthright manner, leaned over to his neighbor and murmured with some disbelief, \\\"Ain't it something, seein' all these men here for a matter of state? A rare sight, that's for sure.\\\" His neighbor grunted in agreement, eyes fixed on the speakers, while Miss Lavender peered at the burgeoning conversations, intrigue lighting her eyes. This meeting, she realized, was more than a mere social call, but a significant gathering meant to shape paths forward-a rare conference to discuss the district's future amidst the changing tides. Yet, as she observed, Miss Lavender noted the human element present beyond the political: neighbors exchanging genuine concern over crops and livestock, or sharing whispers of personal triumphs and tribulations. It was a tapestry woven from strands of everyday life, intersected suddenly by the broader strokes of history and decision. And so, with afternoon sinking slowly toward evening, the discussions carried on, layered with the complexity of voices eager to contribute and mold the communal destiny before them.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"llama\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 600,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"As the press corps continued to pepper Carney with questions, he maintained that the White House had acted with integrity, citing the \\\"cardinal rule\\\" of non-interference in independent investigations. However, his explanations only seemed to fuel the growing skepticism among reporters. One journalist pointed out that if the White House Counsel's Office had received a \\\"top line\\\" notification on April 16, it was unclear why the president had not been informed until May 10, nearly a month later. Carney's response - that the president was not notified because it was an ongoing investigation - was met with raised eyebrows and murmurs of disbelief. Meanwhile, the news of Dennis McDonough's knowledge of the IRS abuses and decision not to inform the president sparked a flurry of questions about the chief of staff's role in the administration. Carney insisted that McDonough had acted appropriately, but the revelation only added to the perception that the White House was engaged in a cover-up. As the briefing wore on, the atmosphere in the room grew increasingly tense. Reporters from major news outlets, including CNN, NBC, and ABC, pressed Carney for more information about the White House's handling of the scandals, but he remained resolute in his defense of the administration. At one point, a reporter from the New York Times asked if the president's credibility was suffering as a result of the scandals, to which Carney replied, \\\"The president's credibility is not in question.\\\" However, polls suggested otherwise. A recent survey by Gallup showed that the president's approval rating had dropped to 45%, with a majority of Americans expressing disapproval of his handling of the IRS, Benghazi, and AP scandals. The same poll found that 55% of respondents believed the IRS's targeting of tea party groups was a \\\"serious problem,\\\" while 53% said the same about the State Department's involvement in the Benghazi scandal. As the briefing drew to a close, Carney was asked about the implications of the scandals for the president's second-term agenda. He responded by saying that the administration remained committed to its priorities, including immigration reform and gun control, but the question on everyone's mind was whether the president's credibility would be enough to push these initiatives through a increasingly skeptical Congress. As the press corps filed out of the briefing room, the sense of unease was palpable. The scandals had created a perfect storm of controversy, and it seemed unlikely that the administration would be able to weather the storm without further damage to its reputation. The question on everyone's mind was what other revelations lay hidden, waiting to surface, and how the White House would respond when they did.\",\n          \"...and then I tripped over my own feet and face-planted into the dirt. Bill just stood there, shaking his head, as I spat out a mouthful of dust and pebbles. \\\"You know, Eli, sometimes I wonder how you've managed to survive this long.\\\" I glared up at him, wiping my mouth with the back of my hand. \\\"Hey, I've got skills. I've just got a little... flair for the dramatic.\\\" Bill raised an eyebrow. \\\"Flair for the dramatic? You call that flair? You call that a face-plant?\\\" I shrugged, scrambling to my feet. \\\"It's all about the delivery, Bill. You've got to commit to the role.\\\" Bill sighed, shaking his head. \\\"You're something else, Eli.\\\" We stood there for a moment, the only sound the distant rumble of thunder. The sky was darkening, and I could smell the rain coming. \\\"Well, what do you say we get moving?\\\" I asked, shouldering my pack. \\\"We've got a ways to go before we reach St. Rose.\\\" Bill nodded, falling into step beside me. \\\"Yeah, and I'm starving. I could eat a whole horse.\\\" I grinned. \\\"Well, I've got some dried peas and beef jerky that'll have to do.\\\" Bill groaned. \\\"You know, sometimes I think you're more of a curse than a blessing.\\\" I chuckled, clapping him on the back. \\\"Hey, that's what friends are for, right?\\\" The rain started to fall just as we crested a small hill, and we huddled together under a scrawny tree, watching the storm roll in. The thunder boomed and crackled, and the lightning flashed, casting eerie shadows on the ground. I lit a cigarette, taking a long drag as the rain drummed against my face. \\\"You know, Bill, sometimes I think this is the only life I've ever known. This... this chaos, this madness. I don't know if I'd even recognize peace if it bit me.\\\" Bill looked at me, his eyes serious. \\\"You're getting philosophical, Eli. You must be tired.\\\" I snorted, blowing out a stream of smoke. \\\"I'm just saying, what's the point of it all? Is it just survival, or is there something more?\\\" Bill shrugged. \\\"I don't know, Eli. But I do know one thing - we've got to keep moving. We've got to keep searching for something better.\\\" I nodded, taking another drag on my cigarette. \\\"Yeah, you're right. We've got to keep moving. And maybe, just maybe, we'll find what we're looking for.\\\" The storm raged on, and we huddled together, two small, insignificant figures in a world gone mad. But for a moment, just a moment, I felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, we'd find a way to make things right again.\",\n          \"As she stood thus, a gentle zephyr, carrying the sweet scent of the earliest wild cherry blossoms, caressed her face, and she nodded to herself, as if in confirmation of some private thought. The sun, now high in the sky, cast dappled shadows on the forest floor, and the soft rustle of leaves beneath her feet was like a gentle accompaniment to her musings. The creek, swollen by recent rains, babbled and chattered its way over the smooth stones, its voice growing louder as she approached the Barton farm-house. As she emerged from the wood, the farm-house came into view, its weathered boards a deep, rich brown, and its roof, a soft, mossy green. Smoke drifted lazily from the chimney, carrying the savory aroma of roasting meat, and Miss Lavender's eyes twinkled with anticipation. She quickened her pace, her eyes scanning the assembled company, which now numbered some twenty or thirty horsemen, all of whom seemed to be engaged in animated conversation. The sound of laughter and the clinking of glasses carried on the air, and Miss Lavender's curiosity was piqued. As she approached the group, a tall, dark-haired young man, with piercing blue eyes and a strong, square jaw, detached himself from the throng and came towards her. \\\"Miss Lavender, welcome!\\\" he exclaimed, doffing his hat and bowing low. \\\"I see you've arrived just in time. We're about to begin.\\\" Miss Lavender's eyes sparkled with interest as she took in the young man's words, and she nodded her head in response. \\\"I wouldn't have missed it for the world, Mr. Barton,\\\" she replied, her voice low and husky. \\\"What's the occasion, pray tell?\\\" Mr. Barton's eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled. \\\"Why, it's the annual fox hunt, of course!\\\" he exclaimed. \\\"The best riders from four townships have gathered here today to test their mettle against the cunning of our local Reynard. We've had reports of a particularly wily fox in the area, and we're determined to run him to ground.\\\" Miss Lavender's eyes shone with excitement as she listened, and she nodded her head in approval. \\\"Ah, an excellent sport!\\\" she exclaimed. \\\"I've always said there's no better way to clear the blood and stir the spirits than a good fox hunt.\\\" As she spoke, a loud halloo went up from the assembled company, and the horsemen began to mount their steeds. Miss Lavender watched, her eyes shining with excitement, as the riders formed into a line, their horses prancing and snorting with anticipation. The air was electric with tension, and Miss Lavender could feel the thrill of the hunt coursing through her very veins. She knew that this was going to be a day to remember, a day that would be talked about for weeks to come in the taverns and farmhouses of the four townships. And as the riders set off with a loud whoop, Miss Lavender stood tall, her eyes fixed on the disappearing figures, her heart pounding with excitement.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk_1_embeddings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk_2_embeddings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gpt_embeddings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"llama_embeddings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk_2_sim\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 600,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8995392322540283,\n          0.9716879725456238,\n          0.9886733293533325\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gpt_sim\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 600,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8667473196983337,\n          0.7444583177566528,\n          0.9285728931427002\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"llama_sim\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 600,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8769165873527527,\n          0.8765256404876709,\n          0.9259138703346252\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk_2_vs_gpt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk_2_vs_llama\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"llm_chunk2_vs_gpt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"gpt\",\n          \"chunk_2\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"llm_chunk2_vs_gpt_prob\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.34196944024793613,\n        \"min\": 0.00048785714872448245,\n        \"max\": 0.9999687980826114,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 443,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9971990733866504,\n          0.817574471748733\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"llm_chunk2_vs_llama\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"llama\",\n          \"chunk_2\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"llm_chunk2_vs_llama_prob\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.27711732683719587,\n        \"min\": 0.0007096704254778305,\n        \"max\": 0.9999417087510087,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 467,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9997965730602427,\n          0.6224593312018546\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
